1. Problem Statement
Objective: The goal of this project is to analyze Amazon's sales data to understand sales patterns, identify profitable product categories, and extract insights for improving business strategies, such as sales forecasting, inventory management, and customer segmentation.

Key Questions:

Which products are performing the best?
What is the sales trend over time?
How can sales forecasting help improve business planning?

3. Dataset Overview
Source of Data: The dataset contains sales transactions from Amazon, including product categories, sales volume, revenue, shipping details, and customer feedback.
Columns: Key columns include:

4. Product: The name or category of the product sold.
Order Date: The date when the transaction was made.
Sales or Revenue: The monetary value of sales for a given product.
Customer Reviews: A column indicating feedback from customers, which can give insights into product quality.

5. Data Preprocessing
Handling Missing Data: You would begin by cleaning the dataset, handling any missing or null values. For example, if the Revenue column has missing values, they might be imputed with the average sales for similar products.
Data Transformation: Dates in the Order Date column need to be converted into a datetime format to allow time-based analysis, such as monthly or yearly sales trends.
Feature Engineering: Creating new columns such as Year, Month, or Quarter from the Order Date allows you to analyze sales performance over time.

7. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Sales Trends Over Time: You can analyze total sales for each year, quarter, or month to observe any seasonal trends in sales volume. For example, you might discover that sales spike during holiday seasons.
Top-Performing Products: Bar charts and pie charts are used to visualize which products generate the most revenue. This helps identify top categories to focus on.
Sales by Region: If geographic data is available, you could visualize which regions contribute most to sales, helping the business optimize its supply chain.
Customer Sentiment Analysis: If customer reviews are part of the dataset, text analytics techniques, such as sentiment analysis, can be used to gauge customer satisfaction.

8. Dashboard Creation Using Power BI
Interactive Dashboard: The Power BI dashboard visualizes key metrics such as:
Total Revenue by Year: A line or bar chart shows how sales are increasing or decreasing over time.

Top 5 Product Categories: A pie chart visualizes the top-performing products in terms of sales.

Sales Trends by Month/Quarter: A line chart visualizes monthly or quarterly sales to identify seasonality in product sales.
Sales by Region: If geographic data is available, maps can be used to visualize which regions are driving the most sales

9.Conclusion and Business Value
